# trivia
Trivia game created for Tandem code challenge.

## How to Run

## Assumptions
* 10 questions per trivia round
* all questions are multiple choice
* data in json is formatted in a list of objects, each object containing a "question", "incorrect", and "correct" property
    * program does(will) account for potential data issues and will display a message to users

## Desired Potential Additional Features
* UI - I have experience working with javaFX (see [moono project](https://github.com/selenaqian/moono)), but I chose to
focus on creating clean, tested code rather than working on a user interface.
* Question difficulty - This code could definitely be extended to allow for variable point values based on a data file or
some other method of determining how hard a question is.
* Multiplayer - I could see this also being extended into something web-based or otherwise that allows for multiple people
to be playing the same set of questions and getting a ranking at the end.
